Focused Crawling using the keyword "solar"
DFS Focused Crawling:
	-The crawler first takes a seed url which is 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy' and then it retrieves a list of urls
	of which it takes the first url and crawls it.
	-Next it retrieves urls under the first child of the seed url and similarly it crawls deeper until a depth of 5 is reached
	wherein the first depth is the seed url level which is 1.
	-After reaching depth 5 it starts backtracking and crawls all the urls which were added to stack in similar manner as the first url mentioned above.
	-Here important part is that it looks for links and anchor texts containing the keyword 'solar' in lower,upper and Camel case.

	According to my observation DFS is faster than  BFS and the number of links crawled are also less than those crawled by BFS.
	DFS might give links that are of low quality since it goes much deeper.
	 
	Number of links crawled: 723 
	Time taken: 5-10 mins

BFS Focused Crawling:
	-The crawler crawls all the neighbours of the seedurl and then starts crawling the children of the neighbours and similarly it crawls urls at
	a level once then goes to next level and so on.  
	-BFS takes more time to crawl as compared to DFS
	-Links crawled are more than those crawled by DFS.
	-BFS might more relevent and better links than DFS.
	
	Number of links crawled: 1000 atmost with depth 3
	Time taken: Approx 20-25 mins
