Task3 explanation:

	After crawling the 2 seed urls into 2 different files following steps can be carried out for merging with minimal loss of information:
		1. First take 1st file and use readlines() to get the links into a final list
		2. Now take 2nd file and get the links into the final list 
		3. Compare if duplicates exist and remove them.
		4. Get links from top of the files so that important and relevant links are obtained.
